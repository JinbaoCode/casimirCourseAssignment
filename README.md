## Project Overview

This project focuses on generating load-displacement curves as Casimir Course assignment.

Our objective is to characterize the tensile properties of a material by analyzing experimental data in Excel format using Python programming. To achieve this, we will read the Excel files and perform data analysis to generate load-time, displacement-time, and load-displacement curves for the six samples (Task 1 and Task 2). Building upon this, we will proceed to analyze the dissipation energy of the six samples based on their load-displacement curves (Task 3). Finally, we will calculate the average load-displacement curve, which represents the material's overall tensile behavior (Task 4). This average curve will be directly applicable in the corresponding Finite Element Model (FEM) for extensive research purposes.
